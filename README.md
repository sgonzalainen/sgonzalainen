### Apps 💻

#### [SpotiFeat](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/SpotiFeat)
Spotify app where users can generate playlists taking into account the musical taste of other spotify users. Perfect for a party!

The app runs on **Flask** and it makes use of a supervised musical genre **neural network** classifier based on pure audio and **community** of artists. 

The database used is **MySQL**.

### Machine Learning 🤖
#### [Diamond Pries Inclass ML competition](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/IH-P6-Inclass_ML_Competition)

Inclass Kaggle competition against other Ironhackers. Goal is simple: to optimize the prediction of diamonds prices being 'optimize' understood as to improve as much as possible the model metric, not to find a sweet balance between great metric and explanability.

Tried Models: **Linear regression**, **KNNs**, **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** using **Scikit-learn**.

Funny competition where I confirmed my addiction to hyperparameters fine-tuning and played around with the concept of **stacking**.



### APIs 📚
#### [Friends TV Series API](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/IH-P5-Friends_API_NLTK)

Local API where you can retrieve script info of this amazing TV series.

The API offers multiple GET and POST method endpoints, check out the detailed API documentation available for further information.

It also includes **sentiment analysis** scoring.

The database used is **MongoDB**.

### Geoqueries 🌍
#### [Best Office Venue for a gaming company](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/IH-P4-GeoScoring_Offices)

Finding the best office location for a gaming company given a set of employees with a list of nice-to-haves.

The scoring system takes into account the role and number of employees that are satisfied by each feature by using **python classess**.

For data gathering I made use of **Foursquare** and **Google APIs**.

**Folium** library used for map visulization.

### Web Scraping 🔎
#### [Tennis Stats Pipeline](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/IH-P3-Pipeline_Tennis_Stats)

Enriched a Tennis results dataset with additional player stats by **web scraping**. **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup** technologies used.

### Data Wrangling 👷
#### [Sharks attacks USA vs Australia](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/IH-P2-Sharks_Data_Wrangling)

Cleaning a heavily dirty dataset from Kaggle with low usability and finding insights. 

Visualization by **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** libraries.


### Games 🎮
#### [BlackJack Game](https://github.com/sgonzalainen/IH-P1-BlackJack)

My very first python project where you can play consecutive hands and see stats.
